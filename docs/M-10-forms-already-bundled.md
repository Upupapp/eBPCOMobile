# M-10 asks for forms the app already ships — for ten of the nineteen

*Audited 31 August 2026 in `eBPCO-Mobile-App`. Front-end mobile only. Every
figure measured, and the one thing that could not be measured is named as
such.*

---

## Why this audit happened

M-10 sits in the register as *"Provide the Unified Building Permit Application
Form and Unified Application Form for Certificate of Occupancy so wizard fields
can be audited field-for-field"*, against an external party.

Before asking anyone for anything, the question worth answering is what the app
already has. It has more than the register assumed.

## What is on disk

**Eighteen blank PDFs under `assets/permits/`**, registered in `pubspec.yaml`,
~6.6 MB: seventeen application forms plus the OBO's documentary checklist. All
nineteen permit types resolve to one. Three building sub-types share a single
file, because Castilla's Unified Application Form covers New Construction,
Renovation / Alteration and Addition / Extension through its own Scope of Work
checkboxes.

`permit_forms.dart` flags **fourteen** of them as genuine Castilla or BFP
documents. The other five are generic reference templates standing in for forms
the LGU has not published — and the screen labels them as such, which is the
part of that promise a test can hold, and now does.

## The finding

The requirements catalogue makes a second provenance judgement about the same
nineteen permits: `verified` — *"true only where this entry was built from an
actual Castilla or BFP form rather than a national-law baseline or a
placeholder"*. **Four are true.**

Fourteen against four. **Ten permits ship a form the app calls Castilla's own
while their requirements were built from a national baseline instead:**

Renovation / Alteration · Addition / Extension · Civil/Structural · Electrical ·
Electronics · Mechanical · Plumbing · Sanitary/Plumbing · Fencing · Excavation

Either the catalogue is behind the forms — in which case **ten wizards can be
audited field-for-field today, against paper already in this repository, with
nothing required from the LGU** — or the form flag is optimistic. Both are
worth knowing and neither is mine to settle.

### The sharpest case is a three-way one

New Construction, Renovation / Alteration and Addition / Extension share **one
physical form**. The catalogue records the first as built from a Castilla form
and the other two as not. Same paper, three permits, two verdicts. They cannot
all be right, and no external party is needed to work out which.

## What could not be measured, and why it is said out loud

The `isOfficialCastillaForm` flag is a human judgement, and this audit could not
verify it. Of the fourteen forms flagged as genuine, **two** — Fencing and
Sanitary/Plumbing — carry the words *CASTILLA* and *SORSOGON* in text these
tools can extract, by two independent extraction methods.

For the other twelve, the absence of those words is **not evidence of
anything**: the pages are images, and neither `strings` nor a stream-level text
extractor reads them. A first attempt found the marker in Sanitary/Plumbing and
missed it in Fencing, which is exactly how a measurement tool proves itself
unreliable. So the gate **pins** the flags rather than verifying them, and says
so where somebody might otherwise assume it had checked.

## What guards it

`test/architecture/bundled_forms_test.dart`, six tests:

- every declared form is on disk, non-empty, and resolves for all nineteen
  types — the failure being a form dropped from the bundle while its entry
  stays, so the screen offers an applicant a document that does not exist,
  offline, which is exactly when they cannot go and look;
- no PDF ships unreferenced;
- the assets are registered, without which none of the above ships at all;
- a stand-in form is labelled as one on screen;
- the 14-against-4 counts;
- and the ten disagreements **by name**, so resolving one fails the test and
  says which, and adding an eleventh does too.

## What this changes about M-10

It does not close it. The Certificate of Occupancy form is one of the five
stand-ins, and the DPWH/JMC unified forms are still worth having as the
national reference.

What it changes is the size and the order. **Ten of the nineteen wizards can be
audited now**, against files already committed here.

### Correction, same day: this lane can read them

The paragraph that stood here said the audit needed *"someone who can open a
PDF and read a form"* and that this was *"work this lane cannot do — reading a
scanned form is not a source scan"*. **Wrong, and wrong because I did not
try.** Every Mac ships `qlmanage`, which renders a PDF page to an image that
can then be read directly. `tool/render-form.sh` is the two lines it takes, and
`docs/FORM-AUDIT-METHOD.md` records the method, its real limit — page one only,
since there is no poppler and no Homebrew on this machine — and the first
audit's findings.

That first audit, on the Fencing Permit, found a field the form asks for and
the wizard did not collect, sitting behind a comment that asserted the form had
no such field. It also settles that form's `isOfficialCastillaForm` flag by
reading its letterhead — the third method tried, and the only conclusive one.
